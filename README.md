# undistract-me

Notifies you when long-running terminal commands complete.

## What is this?

Does this ever happen to you?

You're doing some work, and as part of that you need to run a command on the
terminal that takes a little while to finish.  You run the command, watch it
for maybe a second and then switch to doing something else â€“ checking
email or something.

You get so deeply involved in your email that twenty minutes fly by.  When
you switch back to your terminal the command has finished, but you've got no
idea whether it was nineteen seconds ago or nineteen *minutes* ago.

This happens to me a lot.  I'm just not disciplined enough to sit and watch
commands, and I'm not prescient enough to add something to each invocation to
tell me.  What I want is something that alerts me whenever long running
commands finish.

This is it.

Install this, and then you'll get a notification when any command finishes
that took longer than ten seconds to finish.

## Installation

### From the branch

    $ bzr checkout --lightweight lp:undistract-me
    $ . undistract-me/long-running.bash
    $ notify_when_long_running_commands_finish_install

### From a PPA

    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:undistract-me-packagers/daily
    $ sudo apt-get install undistract-me

Then run a login shell: start a whole new Gnome Terminal, run `bash --login`
or log out then log in again.

## Configuration

By default, a long-running command is any command that takes more than 10s to
complete.  If this default is not right for you, set
`LONG_RUNNING_COMMAND_TIMEOUT` to a different number of seconds and export it.
It is possible to disable notifications for certain commands by adding them 
space-separated to `LONG_RUNNING_IGNORE_LIST` variable.

## Licensing

All of undistract-me, including this file, is made available with the Expat

## Getting help

There's no dedicated IRC channel, but feel free to ping `jml` on Freenode,
probably in the `#ubuntu-devel` channel.
